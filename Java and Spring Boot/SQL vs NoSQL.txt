SQL Databases:

Data Model: SQL databases follow a structured, tabular data model with predefined schemas. They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for defining and manipulating data.
	Pros:
		ACID Compliance:
			SQL databases provide strong transactional consistency, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
		Mature and Established:
			SQL databases have been widely used for decades, resulting in a mature ecosystem with well-defined standards, tools, and support.
		Complex Queries:
			SQL databases excel at complex queries, aggregations, and joins, making them suitable for applications with complex relationships and reporting needs.
	Cons:
		Fixed Schema:
			SQL databases require a predefined schema, making it challenging to handle dynamic, evolving, or unstructured data.
		Vertical Scalability:
			Scaling SQL databases vertically (increasing hardware resources) can be costly and limited.
		Limited Horizontal Scalability:
			While SQL databases can scale horizontally, it often involves more effort and complexity compared to NoSQL databases.
		Use Cases:
			SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require strong data consistency, complex queries, and structured data, such as financial systems,
			inventory management, and content management systems.

NoSQL Databases:

Data Model: NoSQL databases offer various data models like key-value, document, columnar, and graph, providing more flexibility and scalability options.
	Pros:
		Flexible Schema: NoSQL databases allow for dynamic and schema-less data, accommodating evolving and unstructured data.
		Horizontal Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for easy horizontal scalability, enabling distributed data storage and high scalability.
		Performance: NoSQL databases can achieve high read and write throughput, making them suitable for applications with massive amounts of data or high traffic.
	Cons:
		Eventual Consistency: NoSQL databases may sacrifice strong consistency for high availability and scalability, resulting in eventual consistency models.
		Limited Query Capabilities: NoSQL databases often lack the full power and flexibility of complex queries and joins offered by SQL databases.
		Learning Curve: NoSQL databases introduce new concepts and query languages, requiring a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with them.
		Use Cases: NoSQL databases are ideal for applications with large-scale data, high throughput requirements, dynamic or unstructured data, real-time analytics,
			and distributed systems, such as social networks, IoT platforms, recommendation engines, and logging systems.
