status == how are you? [good/bad]

state == what are you doing? [resting/working]

State generally refers to the entire state of an entity - all its values and relationships at a particular point in time (usually, current)

Status is more of a time-point, say, where something is at in a process or workflow - is it dirty (therefore requiring saving), is it complete,
is it pending input, etc

In Veeam technical documentation, we use state when talking about an overall condition of an entity or a result of some operation with the entity
(such as Idle, Running, Disabled, Verified and so on), while status stands for the current condition of an entity with respect to particular circumstances
(such as Success, Failed, Warning and so on).
