Spring IoC (Inversion of Control): In Spring IoC, the control over the object creation and management is shifted from your application code to the Spring container.
Instead of your code directly creating objects, Spring IoC container creates and manages the objects of your application, promoting modularity and easier maintenance.

Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection is a key concept in Spring IoC. It refers to the process of providing the necessary dependencies
(such as objects, services, or configuration values) to a class from the outside. Spring IoC container injects these dependencies into the objects
(usually via constructor, setter, or method injection), reducing tight coupling between components and making the system more flexible, testable, and easier to manage.
