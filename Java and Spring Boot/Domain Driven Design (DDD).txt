Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an architectural approach and methodology that focuses on understanding and modeling complex
business domains to guide the design of software systems. DDD aims to align software development with the business domain's
needs and requirements, enabling the creation of more effective, maintainable, and scalable applications.

Key concepts and principles of Domain-Driven Design include:
	- Ubiquitous Language: DDD emphasizes the use of a common language and terminology between domain experts, stakeholders,
	and developers. This shared language helps ensure that the software model accurately reflects the business domain and
	fosters effective communication.
	- Bounded Contexts: DDD introduces the concept of Bounded Contexts, which are specific boundaries that define distinct
	parts of a system with their own domain models and ubiquitous language. Bounded Contexts help manage complexity and
	enable focused design and development within specific contexts.
	- Aggregate and Aggregate Root: DDD identifies Aggregates as cohesive clusters of related objects that are treated as a
	single unit. An Aggregate Root serves as the entry point and the consistency boundary for the Aggregate. Aggregates
	encapsulate business rules and ensure consistency and integrity within the domain model.
	- Domain Events: Domain Events capture significant changes or occurrences within the domain. They represent important
	business activities and can be used to trigger actions in other parts of the system or communicate between Bounded
	Contexts.
	- Value Objects: Value Objects represent small, immutable objects that have no identity and are solely defined by their
	attributes. They are used to model concepts that are valuable primarily for their attributes and behavior.
	- Repositories: Repositories provide a standardized interface to access and persist domain objects. They abstract away
	the underlying data storage details and enable the application to work with domain objects without direct coupling to
	data access mechanisms.
	- Domain Services: Domain Services encapsulate business logic and behavior that doesn't naturally belong to a specific
	entity or value object. They represent operations or actions that have a strong association with the domain but don't
	fit into the responsibility of a single object.
	
DDD encourages close collaboration between domain experts and developers, enabling a deep understanding of the business domain
and ensuring that the software reflects the domain's complexity, rules, and requirements accurately.

By focusing on the domain and adopting practices like strategic modeling, ubiquitous language, and domain-driven design patterns,
DDD aims to build software systems that are more maintainable, scalable, and aligned with the needs of the business domain.
