TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a widely used transport protocol in computer networks.
TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication between devices over an IP network.

Here are key features and characteristics of TCP:
	- Reliable Communication:
		TCP ensures reliable delivery of data by implementing mechanismssuch as acknowledgment,
		retransmission, and sequencing. It guarantees that data sent from one device will be
		received accurately and in the same order by the receiving device.
	- Connection-Oriented:
		TCP establishes a connection between two devices before data transfer begins. This
		connection setup involves a handshake process, where the devices exchange control messages
		to synchronize their communication parameters and establish the connection.
	- Flow Control:
		TCP includes flow control mechanisms to manage the rate of data transmission between devices.
		It prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver by dynamically adjusting the transmission
		rate based on the receiver's ability to process the data.
	- Byte Stream:
		TCP treats data as a stream of bytes without any specific message boundaries. It breaks down the
		application data into smaller segments, encapsulates them into TCP segments, and reassembles them
		at the receiving end.
	- Connection Termination:
		TCP provides a graceful connection termination process. Devices exchange control messages to close
		the connection properly.
		
TCP is widely used for applications that require reliable, error-free data transfer, such as web browsing,
email, file transfer, remote access, and other network services.
