You are correct that when querying a many-to-many relationship in a relational database, it often involves breaking it down into a combination of one-to-many and
many-to-one relationships. This decomposition is necessary because the underlying database structure represents many-to-many relationships using junction tables.

In a many-to-many relationship, retrieving related data typically requires joining the relevant tables through the junction table. The resulting query involves
combining one-to-many and many-to-one relationships to obtain the desired data.

For example, consider the "Books" and "Authors" many-to-many relationship. To retrieve all books written by a specific author, you would need to perform the
following steps:
 - Join the junction table "BookAuthor" with the "Books" table, using the foreign key relationship between them. This creates a one-to-many relationship between
	"BookAuthor" and "Books" for the selected author.
 - Join the junction table "BookAuthor" with the "Authors" table, using the foreign key relationship between them. This creates a many-to-one relationship between
	"BookAuthor" and "Authors" for the selected author.
 - Apply the filter condition to select the desired author.

The resulting query combines these relationships to fetch the books written by the specified author.

While the actual query might involve breaking down the many-to-many relationship into multiple one-to-many and many-to-one relationships, the intent and outcome
remain focused on retrieving the related data based on the original many-to-many association.

ORM frameworks, such as Hibernate, provide abstractions that handle these complexities internally, allowing developers to work with many-to-many relationships
more intuitively in their object-oriented models. The framework takes care of generating the appropriate SQL queries and managing the underlying junction tables
transparently.
