How do you check if the field is null or blank in the controller layer in the request body for bank TO that has a name and address?
Name - not null
Address - not null and not empty

	To check if a field is null or blank in the request body for a bank transfer object (TO) that has a name and address in the controller layer
	of a Spring Boot application, you can use validation annotations provided by Spring Framework. Here's how you can do it:

	1. Add Validation Annotations to the Transfer Object:
	Add validation annotations to the fields of the transfer object (TO) class to specify the constraints. For example, you can use @NotBlank to ensure that a field is not null or empty.
	
	public class BankTO {
		@NotNull(message = "Name cannot be blank")
		private String name;

		@NotBlank(message = "Address cannot be blank")
		private String address;

		// Getters and setters
	}
	
	2. Use @Valid Annotation in Controller Method Parameter:
	In your controller method where you handle the request, use the @Valid annotation on the transfer object parameter.
	This annotation triggers validation of the object based on the defined constraints.	
	
	import javax.validation.Valid;
	import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;

	@RestController
	@Validated
	public class BankController {

		@PostMapping("/bank")
		public ResponseEntity<String> createBank(@Valid @RequestBody BankTO bankTO) {
			// Handle the request
		}
	}
	
	3. Handle Validation Errors:
	If the request body contains null or blank values for the name or address fields, Spring Boot will automatically perform validation and return a validation error response.
	You can customize the error handling to return a more appropriate response to the client.
	
	By using validation annotations and @Valid in your controller layer, you can ensure that the fields in the request body are not null or blank before processing the request.
	This helps maintain data integrity and prevents invalid data from being processed by your application.
