Authentication and authorization are two distinct concepts related to security in software systems. Although they are often used together, they serve different purposes:

Authentication:
	- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It ensures that the claimed identity is valid and matches the provided credentials.
	- Authentication answers the question, "Who are you?" and establishes trust between the user/entity and the system.
	- It typically involves validating credentials such as usernames, passwords, tokens, or certificates provided by the user or client.
	- Successful authentication grants the user/entity access to the system, allowing them to proceed with authorized actions.

Authorization:
	- Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or functionalities based on the authenticated user's permissions or roles.
	- Authorization answers the question, "What are you allowed to do?" and determines whether the user/entity has the necessary privileges to perform a particular operation.
	- It involves defining and enforcing access control policies, permissions, and restrictions.
	- Authorization ensures that authenticated users can only access or perform actions that they are authorized to, based on their assigned roles, permissions, or other
	access control mechanisms.
	
In summary, authentication focuses on validating the identity of a user or entity, whereas authorization determines what actions or resources the authenticated user or entity
can access or manipulate. Authentication establishes trust, while authorization governs access rights and permissions.
