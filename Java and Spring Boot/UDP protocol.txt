UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is another widely used transport protocol in computer networks, alongside TCP. Unlike TCP, UDP is a connectionless protocol,
which means it does not establish a connection before sending data. Here are key features and characteristics of UDP:

	Unreliable Communication:
		UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery of data. It provides a best-effort delivery mechanism, where packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order.
		There are no mechanisms for acknowledgment, retransmission, or sequencing in UDP.
	Connectionless:
		UDP does not establish a connection before sending data. Each packet is treated independently, and there is no handshaking process between the sender and receiver.
	No Flow Control:
		UDP does not include flow control mechanisms. It does not manage the rate of data transmission between devices, so the sender can overwhelm the receiver.
	Datagram Oriented:
		UDP treats data as independent datagrams or packets. Each packet has its own header containing source and destination port numbers, checksum, and other control information.
	Lightweight:
		UDP is lightweight compared to TCP because it has fewer features and overhead. It is suitable for applications where low latency and minimal overhead are more important
		than reliability, such as real-time streaming, online gaming, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System) queries.

In summary, UDP prioritizes speed and simplicity over reliability and connection management, making it suitable for certain types of applications where occasional packet loss or out-of-order delivery is acceptable.
