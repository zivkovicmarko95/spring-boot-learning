This control ranges from a session timeout to enabling concurrent sessions and other advanced security configs.

We can control exactly when our session gets created and how Spring Security will interact with it:
	- always – A session will always be created if one doesn't already exist.
	- ifRequired – A session will be created only if required (default).
	- never – The framework will never create a session itself, but it will use one if it already exists.
	- stateless – No session will be created or used by Spring Security
	
It's very important to understand that this configuration only controls what Spring Security does, not the entire
application. Spring Security won't create the session if we instruct it not to, but our app might!

The strictest session creation option, “stateless“, is a guarantee that the application won't create any session at all.

If we have to work with session, probably there will be some cookie that we should handle.
