Why do we use treemap

TreeMap is used in scenarios where you need to maintain a sorted order of keys. Here are some reasons why you might choose to use a TreeMap:
    Ordered Keys: TreeMap maintains the keys in sorted order. This can be useful when you need to iterate over the keys in a specific order,
        such as ascending or descending order.
    Efficient Searching: TreeMap uses a Red-Black Tree data structure internally, which provides efficient searching, insertion, and deletion
        operations. The time complexity for these operations is O(log n), making TreeMap suitable for scenarios where you need to perform frequent
        search operations.
    Navigable Operations: TreeMap provides navigable operations such as ceilingKey, floorKey, higherKey, and lowerKey, which can be helpful
        when you need to find keys that are greater than or less than a given key.
