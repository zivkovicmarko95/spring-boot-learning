Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation.
It follows a cycle of writing a test that fails initially, writing the minimum amount of code required to pass the test,
and then refactoring the code while ensuring that all tests continue to pass. This process repeats for each new feature or change
in the codebase. TDD aims to improve code quality, promote better design, and increase confidence in the software's correctness
by ensuring that it behaves as expected according to the defined requirements.
