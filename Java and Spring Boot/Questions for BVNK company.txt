How to validate HTTP request parameters?

	Client-Side Validation: Mention that client-side validation is important for providing immediate feedback to users and improving user experience.
		JavaScript can be used for client-side validation to ensure that input fields meet certain criteria before the form is submitted.

	Server-Side Validation: Highlight the importance of server-side validation to ensure data integrity and security. Server-side validation is essential
		because client-side validation can be bypassed, either intentionally or unintentionally.

	Framework Support: Discuss the use of frameworks and libraries that offer built-in validation features. For example, in a Java Spring Boot application,
		you can use annotations such as @Valid and @RequestBody to automatically validate request parameters against predefined constraints.
	
	Custom Validation Logic: Explain that sometimes custom validation logic is required for specific business rules or data validation requirements that cannot
		be handled by built-in validation mechanisms. You can implement custom validation logic by writing validator classes or methods to check request parameters
		and return appropriate error messages if validation fails.

	Handling Validation Errors: Emphasize the importance of handling validation errors gracefully by returning meaningful error messages to the client. This helps
		users understand why their input was rejected and how they can correct it.

Where would I put validation logic?
	
	In a typical application architecture, validation logic can be placed at multiple layers to ensure robust validation of HTTP request parameters. Here are some common places where validation logic can be implemented:
	
	Controller Layer: In MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectures like Spring MVC in Java or ASP.NET MVC in C#, validation logic is often implemented in the controller layer.
		Controllers receive incoming HTTP requests, extract parameters from the request, and then validate them before processing the request further. This validation ensures
		that only valid data is passed to the underlying business logic for processing.
		
	Service Layer: In more complex applications or those that follow a layered architecture, validation logic can also be implemented in the service layer. Service classes
		encapsulate business logic and interact with repositories or data access objects (DAOs) to perform operations on data. By implementing validation logic in the service
		layer, you centralize validation rules and ensure consistency across different controllers that use the same service.

	Custom Validators: For more specialized validation requirements or complex validation rules, you can create custom validator classes. These validator classes can be standalone
		components responsible for validating specific types of data or enforcing custom business rules. Custom validators can be used in conjunction with annotations (e.g., @Valid)
		in frameworks like Spring Boot to automatically trigger validation based on defined constraints.

How to make a controller method which serves HTTP POST requests? 
	
	To create a controller method that serves HTTP POST requests in a Spring Boot application, you can follow these steps:
		Define a Controller Class: Create a Java class annotated with @RestController or @Controller to indicate that it's a Spring MVC controller.
		Define a Method: Inside the controller class, define a method that will handle the POST request. Annotate the method with @PostMapping to specify that it should handle HTTP POST requests.
		Method Signature: Define the method signature with appropriate parameters to receive the POST request body, request parameters, headers, etc., depending on your application's requirements.
		Business Logic: Implement the business logic inside the method to process the incoming POST request data and perform any necessary operations.
		Return Response: Optionally, return a response from the method to provide feedback to the client. This can be done by returning an object, a ResponseEntity, or using other methods available in Spring MVC.
	
	import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
	import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
	import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
	import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
	import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

	@RestController
	public class MyController {

		@PostMapping("/api/resource")
		public ResponseEntity<String> handlePostRequest(@RequestBody String requestBody) {
			// Process the incoming POST request body
			System.out.println("Received POST request with body: " + requestBody);

			// Perform business logic

			// Return a response
			String responseBody = "Response from server";
			return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(responseBody);
		}
	}
	
	In this example:
		The @RestController annotation is used to define the class as a REST controller.
		The @PostMapping annotation specifies that the handlePostRequest method will handle HTTP POST requests for the /api/resource endpoint.
		The @RequestBody annotation is used to bind the request body to the requestBody parameter.
		Inside the method, you can process the request body and perform any necessary business logic.
		Finally, a ResponseEntity is returned with an HTTP status of 200 (OK) and a response body containing a simple message. You can customize the response as needed based on your application requirements.

	Remember to configure your application properly, including adding dependencies such as spring-boot-starter-web to enable Spring Boot's web capabilities.

How I would handle exceptions? 

	To handle exceptions in a Spring Boot application, you can use several techniques provided by Spring's exception handling mechanisms. Here's how you can handle exceptions in a controller method:
		Using @ExceptionHandler: You can define an @ExceptionHandler method within your controller class to handle specific exceptions. This method will be invoked whenever the specified exception occurs in any of the controller methods.
		Global Exception Handling: Spring Boot provides the @ControllerAdvice annotation, which allows you to define global exception handling across all controllers. You can annotate a class with @ControllerAdvice and define @ExceptionHandler methods within it to handle exceptions.
		ResponseEntityExceptionHandler: Spring Boot also provides a convenient way to handle exceptions through ResponseEntityExceptionHandler. You can extend this class and override its methods to customize the handling of specific exceptions.
	
	Here's an example of how you can handle exceptions in a controller method using @ExceptionHandler:
		import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
		import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
		import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
		import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
		import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

		@RestController
		@ControllerAdvice
		public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

			@ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
			public ResponseEntity<String> handleException(Exception e) {
				// Log the exception
				System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());

				// Return a ResponseEntity with an error message and status code
				return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR).body("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
			}
		}

	In this example:

		The @ExceptionHandler annotation is used to define a method that handles exceptions of type Exception.
		Inside the method, you can log the exception and return an appropriate response to the client. Here, we're returning a 500 Internal Server Error status code along with a custom error message.

How I would fetch an entity from a database?

	To fetch an entity from a database in a Spring Boot application, you can use Spring Data JPA. Spring Data JPA provides repositories that allow you to interact with the database using
	a simple interface without writing boilerplate code for database operations. Here's how you can fetch an entity from a database using Spring Data JPA:

	Define an Entity: First, define an entity class representing the database table. Annotate the class with @Entity and specify the table name using @Table.
	
		import javax.persistence.*;

		@Entity
		@Table(name = "users")
		public class User {
			@Id
			@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
			private Long id;

			private String username;
			private String email;

			// Getters and setters
		}

	Create a Repository Interface: Create a repository interface for the entity by extending the JpaRepository interface provided by Spring Data JPA. Define custom query methods if needed.
		
		import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

		public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
			// Define additional query methods if needed
		}

	Inject the Repository: Inject the repository interface into your service or controller class where you want to fetch the entity.

		import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

		@Service
		public class UserService {
			private final UserRepository userRepository;

			public UserService(final UserRepository userRepository) {
				this.userRepository = userRepository;
			}

			public User getUserById(final Long id) {
				return userRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException(String.format("Entity with ID %s is not found", id)));
			}
		}

What is a pupose of @Trasnactional annotation?
	
	The @Transactional annotation in Spring provides declarative transaction management for methods or classes. It is used to demarcate transaction boundaries,
	meaning it specifies the scope of a single transaction.

	The purpose of the @Transactional annotation includes:

		Managing Transactions: It allows you to specify transactional behavior for methods or classes without explicitly managing transactions programmatically.
		Starting and Committing Transactions: When a method annotated with @Transactional is invoked, a transaction is started before the method is executed,
			and the transaction is committed after the method completes successfully.
		Rolling Back Transactions: If an exception occurs during the execution of a method annotated with @Transactional, the transaction is rolled back, ensuring
			data consistency and integrity.
		Transaction Propagation: The @Transactional annotation supports various propagation behaviors, such as REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, NESTED, etc., which define
			how transactions are propagated when methods are called within the same or different transactional contexts.
		Isolation Levels: It allows you to specify isolation levels for transactions, defining the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from the effects
			of other concurrently executing transactions.
		Read-only Transactions: You can configure transactions to be read-only using the readOnly attribute of the @Transactional annotation, which can improve performance
			by avoiding unnecessary locking and logging.
	
	Overall, the @Transactional annotation simplifies transaction management in Spring applications, promoting cleaner code and reducing boilerplate transaction handling logic.
	It is commonly used in service layer methods that interact with the database to ensure data consistency and integrity.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
If you have checked and unchecked exceptions in which case transaction will rollback in which case it will not:
	
	In Java, transactions are typically rolled back for unchecked exceptions, which are subclasses of RuntimeException.
	These unchecked exceptions are considered critical errors that indicate a failure in the application logic or system state.
	Common unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException, IllegalStateException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, and RuntimeException.
	When an unchecked exception occurs within a transactional context and is not caught and handled within that context, the transaction will be automatically rolled back by default.
	On the other hand, checked exceptions, which are subclasses of Exception but not subclasses of RuntimeException, do not usually trigger a transaction rollback by default. Checked exceptions are considered recoverable errors, and the application can choose to handle them without necessarily rolling back the transaction.
	However, you can configure specific checked exceptions to trigger a transaction rollback using annotations like @Transactional in Spring Framework. For example:
	
	import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

	@Transactional(rollbackFor = {SomeCheckedException.class})
	public void someTransactionalMethod() throws SomeCheckedException {
		// Transactional code
		if (someCondition) {
			throw new SomeCheckedException();
		}
	}
	
	In this example, if SomeCheckedException is thrown, the transaction will be rolled back because it's explicitly configured to do so.
	In summary:
		Unchecked exceptions (i.e., subclasses of RuntimeException or Error) usually result in automatic rollback of the transaction.
		Checked exceptions (i.e., subclasses of Exception that are not RuntimeExceptions) generally do not trigger automatic rollback but can be configured to do so if needed.

How to define exceptions that should rollback the transaction:

	To define exceptions that should trigger a rollback of the transaction while using Spring's declarative transaction management, you can use the rollbackFor attribute in the @Transactional annotation.
	Here's an example of how you can define the rollbackFor attribute to specify which exceptions should trigger a rollback:
	
	import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

	@Transactional(rollbackFor = Exception.class)
	public void yourTransactionalMethod() {
		// Your transactional logic here
	}
	
	In this example, Exception.class is specified in the rollbackFor attribute, which means that any exception of type Exception or its subclasses will cause the transaction to be rolled back.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to define the only one exception that should NOT rollback the transaction:

	To define an exception that should not trigger a rollback of the transaction while using Spring's declarative transaction management, you can specify a noRollbackFor attribute in the @Transactional annotation.
	Here's an example of how you can define the noRollbackFor attribute to exclude a specific exception from causing a rollback:

	import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;

	@Transactional(noRollbackFor = SpecificException.class)
	public void yourTransactionalMethod() {
		// Your transactional logic here
	}
	
	In this example, SpecificException is the exception type that you want to exclude from triggering a rollback. When SpecificException occurs within the yourTransactionalMethod(), the transaction will not be rolled back.
